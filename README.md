**Abstract:**   
Upon acute viral infection, a typical cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response is
characterized by a phase of expansion and contraction after which it settles
at a relatively stable memory level. Recently, experimental data from mice
infected with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) showed different and unusual
dynamics. After acute infection had resolved, some antigen specific CTL
started to expand over time despite the fact that no replicative virus was
detectable. This phenomenon has been termed as "CTL memory inflation". In
order to examine the dynamics of this system further, we developed a
mathematical model analysing the impact of innate and adaptive immune
responses. According to this model, a potentially important contributor to CTL
inflation is competition between the specific CTL response and an innate
natural killer (NK) cell response. Inflation occurs most readily if the NK
cell response is more efficient than the CTL at reducing virus load during
acute infection, but thereafter maintains a chronic virus load which is
sufficient to induce CTL proliferation. The model further suggests that weaker
NK cell mediated protection can correlate with more pronounced CTL inflation
dynamics over time. We present experimental data from mice infected with MCMV
which are consistent with the theoretical predictions. This model provides
valuable information and may help to explain the inflation of CMV specific
CD8+T cells seen in humans as they age.
